# distributed-systems-simulator

* This is Distributed Systems Simulator written in Java. As a CS student, I'm highly interested in Distributed Systems, not only applications like Hadoop, Sparks, etc but also the theories. It's quite hard to maintain a private cluster so I decide to write a Java-based simulator to help me (and potentially other people) to understand distributed systems technologies as well as provide a Simulator to implement different strategies regarding distributed technlogies. 

* Another reason I'm writing this project is I'm feeling this could be a good practice for Object-oriented design patterns. 

* Action items
- [] Abstract basic infrastructure level hardware and resources
- [] Illustrate MapReduce
- [] Illustrate HDFS(GFS)
